Enable the lesstodon user to follow other users.  First we'll follow "ourselves" on lesstodon... then we'll follow other users outside of lesstodon.

The idea here is that by following external users we can start categorizing the types of things that come in to the inbox so that we can replicate it from the lesstodon side.

  - [ ] Store pending follower in DynamoDB
  - [ ] Send http request to mastodon/lesstdon
  - [ ] Receive acknowledgement back and store result in dynamodb
  - [ ] Stretch: Store / categorize types of events received to the inbox
