# Serverless-ActivityPub

***(aka Serverless Mastodon aka Matsodonless aka Lesstodon)***

This is a CDK-based Serverless Implementation of ActivityPub that is (or will be) compatible with Mastodon.

**You should absolutely not use this *(for now)***... it's a POC and most APIs are not implemented (yet).

## TODO:

- [ ] ***[ACTIVE FOCUS]*** Follow users on another server
- [ ] Send "Toots" to followers
- [ ] Unit tests ðŸ˜…
- [ ] Arch diagram(s)
- [ ] List out APIs to convert in TODO List... (https://docs.joinmastodon.org/dev/routes/)

## Completed:
- [x] Convert from single-user to multi-user
- [x] Single User webfinger
- [x] Follow single user from mastodon
- [x] Unfollow single user from mastodon
- [x] Webfinger endpoint (endpoint used by external mastodons for user search)
